                        ---- GrblController ----

GrblController is a gcode sender, monitor and homing tool for GRBL for
Mac, Windows and Linux systems written using the Qt Desktop Framework in C++.

Enhanced by Zapmaker. Kosme did a great deal of excellent foundation work on this
project.

v3.6.1-T4  (LETARTARE proposals July 29, 2014)

An executable 'Win32' into 'GCV-3.6.1-T4-cb.jtgcv'.  
This is a file Win32 compressed, change the extension 'jtgcv -> 7z' to decompress.

* 3.6.1-T3 +

1- Analyzes the gcode with 4 axes X, Y, Z, T   ( fourth axis )

2- New display console ('Console') commands, with the ability to cut, copy,
   paste, delete text part

3- Display speed rate XYZ with 'Lcd'

4- Visualizes the 'Gcode' XYZ 3D with motion mouse
	- A help button to explain the multiple possible actions on the drawing
	  by utilsation keyboard and mouse
	- You can see it or not the box limits the drawing
	- Choosing a particuler tool
	- Different views are available by buttons
	- Display axes oriented
	- Display a grid in the XY plane
	- Choice of deleting lines G0

5- Animation 3D XYZ axes, regardless of the connection
	- When loading a file, you can read its contents in the console 'Visual'
	  which will launch the manual or automatic animation.
	- In manual mode you can use the mouse to select a line of code or the
	  navigation buttons or sliders keyboard arrows
	- In automatic mode has a period setting reading 'Gcode'

6- In addition to the periodic polling of 'Grbl', a new method is proposed
   EXPERIMENTAL display named 'Synchronous simulation' based on motion prediction
      	- This mode is for use rather large arcs or helical path
      	- It is accessed via 'Tools->Options->Display->Synchronous simulation'

7- The visual presentation of 'GCV has been modified

- Works with versions Grbl :
   1- Three axes 0.8c, 0.9d, 0.9e, 0.9f, 0.9g
   2- Four axes 0845, 0.8c1, 0.8c2 (0.8c to 4 axes) with MEGA2560

Fix old bug to T1, T2, T3 (July 7, 2014)

V3.6.1-T3   (LETARTARE proposals June 06, 2014)

* 3.6.1-T2 +

1- complete analysis of the Grbl version for 0.8cx versions
2- use 'Check' Grbl mode "$C"
3- Updating of the French translation

- Works with versions Grbl :
   1- Three axes 0.8c, 0.9d, 0.9e,
   2- Four axes 0845, 0.8c1 (0.8c to 4 axes) with MEGA2560

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V3.6.1-T2   (LETARTARE proposals June 03, 2014)

* 3.6.1-T1 +

1- Display Grbl version bottom right of the window    (Firmware : Grbl 0.8c)
2- displays the total number of lines of loaded file, on the line runtime  (Lines : 1245)
3- Displays the current line of the file read, on the line runtime  (Lines : 150/1245)
4- Updating of the French translation

- Works with versions Grbl :
   1- Three axes 0.8c, 0.9d, 0.9e,
   2- Four axes 0845, 0.8c1 (0.8c to 4 axes) with MEGA2560
	  https://github.com/LETARTARE/Grbl-xx_with_Arduino/tree/master/Grbl8c1Mega2560

V3.6.1-T1   (LETARTARE proposals June 01, 2014)

- 3.6.1 +
1- Improved to the same card 3 and 4 axis detection
2- Displays the line numbers of the file if no number exists
3- Updating of the French translation

- Works with versions Grbl :
   1- Three axes 0.8c, 0.9d, 0.9e,
   2- Four axes 0845, future 0.8c1 (0.8c to 4 axes)
