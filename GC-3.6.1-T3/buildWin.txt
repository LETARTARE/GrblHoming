To build the executable under Windows, you must have
1- a 'Qt' version installed and compiled, the tests were performed with 'Qt-4.7.3'.
2- 'mingw32' installed to use 'mingw32-make.exe', the tests were performed with 'MinGw32-TDM-4.7.1'

You have to adapt the file 'makeWin.bat' for the paths are correct.

Example :
	set PATH_Qt = ""u:\DONNEES\SVN_COMPILE\qt\4.7.3"
	set PATH_MINGW32 = "o:\DevCpp\MinGw32-TDM"

Open a DOS console and
1 - makeWin.bat
2 - execute.bat

if you want the French translation
3 - translate.bat
4 - execute.bat
